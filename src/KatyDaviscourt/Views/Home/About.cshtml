    I am a Junior Web Developer and former Sign Language Interpreter, and am currently a student at the Epicodus Coding Bootcamp in Seattle. For the last several years, I have worked with the Deaf community providing communications access as an interpreter and volunteering with social services and education. I have a passion for serving others and making sure everyone has equal access to information.

    Programming is an exciting way for me to use logic and innovation to make beautiful, intuitive and seamlessly functional web content for all. I love the challenge inherent in development, from the thoughtful presentation of the front-end to the complex logic of the back-end. Solving a difficult problem, and seeing a web page function the way you want it to, is an amazing feeling.
